# 🧠 Mental Health Condition in Nepal – Data Analysis & Predictive Modeling

## 📌 Overview

This project explores mental health conditions across Nepal using publicly available data. It involves in-depth **data analysis**, **visualization**, and the development of **machine learning models** to identify patterns and predict mental health issues at a regional level.

The goal is to highlight the mental health burden in Nepal and demonstrate how data science can inform awareness, resource allocation, and potential interventions.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze mental health data across all districts of Nepal.
- Visualize trends and disparities in mental health issues.
- Build predictive models to forecast mental health risks.
- Evaluate the performance of multiple ML algorithms.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-Learn  
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Key Visualizations

- Heatmaps and correlation matrices
- Distribution plots by region/district
- Class imbalance checks
- Model performance plots (confusion matrix, accuracy scores)

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

Implemented and compared several ML algorithms including:

- Logistic Regression  
- K-Nearest Neighbors  
- Decision Trees  
- Random Forest

### Model Evaluation:

- Accuracy  
- Precision / Recall  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Cross-validation

---

## ✅ Results

- Identified regions with disproportionately high reported mental health issues.
- Built predictive models with measurable accuracy to estimate risk levels.
- Generated actionable insights for policymakers and NGOs.

---

## 📌 Future Work

- Expand the dataset to include socio-economic or health-related factors.
- Add interactive dashboards using **Streamlit** or **Plotly Dash**.
- Explore unsupervised learning (e.g., clustering for region segmentation).
